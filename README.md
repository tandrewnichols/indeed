# Indeed

Boolean helpers for node.js

## Why Bother?

Simple booleans are efficient and not that hard to use in javascript, so what's the value of a DDL for booleans? Mainly, I just find booleans one of those things that, if I think too hard about them, then I get lost. The project was born when I had

```javascript
if (!oneThing && anotherThing) {
  // . . .
}
```

but then realized I actually needed the negative of `anotherThing`. So I changed it to

```javascript
if (!oneThing && !anotherThing) {
  // . . .
}
```

at which point, I started wondering if that was the same as

```javascript
if (!(oneThing && anotherThing)) {
  // . . .
}
```

And then I thought, what I really want is to say

```javascript
if (neither(oneThing).nor(anotherThing)) {
  // do something
}
```

and thus the module "neither" was born. And then I later changed it to "indeed", which was more globally usable as a boolean helper. A bit of an anti-climatic ending, really. At any rate, this library is just a set of boolean helpers to put `if` statements into English-like syntax. Note that I used to be an English teacher and thus, that syntax is extremely opinionated and grammatically correct. Grammar is your friend.

Ahem . . . now on with the API.

## Installation

```bash
npm install indeed --save
```

then

```javascript
var helpers = require('indeed');
```

or

```javascript
// Set up global methods.
// Mainly useful because I don't like having to say "if (helpers.indeed(a)..."
require('indeed')();
```

## Usage

When you `require('indeed')`, you'll get an object with methods that begin boolean chains: `indeed`, `either`, `neither`, `both`, `allOf`, `oneOf`, `noneOf`, `anyOf`, `nOf`, and `expect`. These function are roughly the same - they allow you to assess conditions using natural language. These conditions are processed first in first out, so they can behave slightly differently than normal boolean logic. For example: `if (a && b || c)` becomes `if (indeed(a).and(b).or(c))` as you might expect. However, `if (indeed(a).or(b).and(c))` actually means `if( (a || b) && c)` because of how order of operations works. See [Grouping](#grouping) below for more information.

#### Indeed

Begins a generic chain.

Chainable methods: `and`, `andNot`, `or`, `orNot`, `butNot`, and `xor`<br>
Chain limit: none

```javascript
if (indeed(a).and(b).butNot(c).or(d).test())
```

Chaining is off by default with `indeed`, so that you can make simple comparisons:

```javascript
// returns 'true'
indeed(a).is.true()

// returns 'indeed' so that you can assert more conditions
indeed.chain(a).is.true() // .and(b).is.false().test()
```

When chaining, use `.test()`, `.val()`, or `.eval()` to terminate the chain and evaluate the total result of the expression. Non-chaining is optimized for [comparisons](#matching), so `indeed(a).is.defined()` will return `true` or `false` whereas `indeed(a)` by itself, will not. To assert on the definedness of a single thing, 1) chain: `if (indeed.chain(a).test())`, 2) use `defined()`: `if (indeed(a).is.defined())`, 3) use regular booleans: `if (a)`. Calling one of the chain methods without calling a comparison will automatically turn on chaining, so that you can say `if (indeed(a).and(b).and(c).test())` rather than `if (indeed.chain(a).and(b).and(c).test())`.

`indeed` is also equipped with some negation tools: `not` and `Not`. `not` simply negates the first condition:

```javascript
if (indeed.not(a).and(b).test())
```

is equivalent to

```javascript
if (!a && b)
```

`Not` negates the result of the chain, so

```javascript
if (indeed.Not(a).and(b).test())
```

is equivalent to

```javascript
if (!(a && b))
```

These too can be chained:

```javascript
if (indeed.not.chain(a).and(b).test())
if (indeed.Not.chain(a).or(b).test())
```

#### Either

Begins a chain where one of two conditions (or both) should be true.

Chainable methods: `or`<br>
Chain limit: 1<br>
Optimized for: existence checks

```javascript
if (either(a).or(b))
if (either.chain(a).is.null().or(b).is.defined().test())
```

#### Neither

Begins a chain where both conditions should be false. 

Chainable methods: `nor`<br>
Chain limit: 1<br>
Optimized for: existence checks

```javascript
if (neither(a).nor(b))
if (neither.chain(a).equals('foo').nor(b).is.a('date').test())
```

#### Both

Begins a chain where both conditions should be true.

Chainable methods: `and`<br>
Chain limit: 1<br>
Optimized for: existence checks

```javascript
if (both(a).and(b))
if (both.chain(a).is.false().and(b).contains('bar').test())
```

#### AllOf

Begins a chain where all conditions should be true. Incidentally, it only makes sense to use this with more than two conditions. With two conditions only, use `both`.

Chainable methods: `and`<br>
Chain limit: none<br>
Chaining is on by default and cannot be turned off since any number of `and`'s can be used

```javascript
if (allOf(a).and(b).and(c).test())
```

#### AnyOf

Begins a chain where at least one condition should be true.

Chainable methods: `and`<br>
Chain limit: none<br>
Chaining is on by default and cannot be turned off since any number of `and`'s can be used

```javascript
if (anyOf(a).and(b).and(c).test())
```

#### OneOf

Begins a chain where exactly one condition should be true.

Chainable methods: `and`<br>
Chain limit: none<br>
Chaining is on by default and cannot be turned off since any number of `and`'s can be used

```javascript
if (oneOf(a).and(b).and(c).test())
```

#### NoneOf

Begins a chain where all of the conditions should be false. With only two conditions, use `neither` instead.

Chainable methods: `and`<br>
Chain limit: none<br>
Chaining is on by default and cannot be turned off since any number of `and`'s can be used

```javascript
if (noneOf(a).and(b).and(c).test())
```

#### NOf

`nOf` is the only helper that deviates from the standard structure. It accepts a number, and then any number of conditions, of which _exactly_ that number must be true.

Chainable methods: `and`<br>
Chain limit: none<br>
Chaining is on by default and cannot be turned off since any number of `and`'s can be used

```javascript
if (n(2).of(a).and(b).and(c).test())
```

#### Expect

Expect is identical to indeed and has all it's additional properties. It adds only a couple things: a `throws` comparison function (detailed below) for asserting that a function throws an exception, a `with` function for passing args to a function that should throw, and `assert`, which is the same as `test` but sounds more test-ish.

## Grouping

You can create groups of chains, which are also evaluated left to right, using the properties `And`, `But`, `Or`, and `Xor`. They do what you would expect:

```javascript
if (indeed(a).or(b).And.indeed(c).test())

if (indeed(a).and(b).Or.indeed(c).test())

if (indeed(a).and(b).Xor.indeed(c).test())

if (indeed(a).and(b).But.not.also(c).test())
```

The first example evaluates `a || b` first and then the result of that with `&& c`. `But` is an alias to `And` because sometimes it feels more natural to say "but" than "and." `indeed` also has several aliases that can be used after joins depending on what you want to say next:

```javascript
// just like indeed
if (indeed(a).or(b).And.also(c).test())

// also just like indeed
if (indeed(a).and(b).Or.else(c).test())

// just like indeed, but negated
if (indeed(a).and(b).But.not.also(c).test())

// just like indeed, but negates the entire next group
if (indeed(a).and(b).But.Not.also(c).or(d).test())
```

Additionally, all of the entry points are chainable after a Grouping property:

```javascript
if (indeed(a).or(b).But.neither(c).nor(d).test())
```

## Matching

All the examples so far have been simple checks for definedness (for simplicity), but `indeed` has a wide variety of comparison functions as well. All of the chain starters also have the chainable properties `does`, `should`, `has`, `have`, `is`, `to`, `be`, `been`, `deep`, `deeply`, `not`, `Not`, `noCase`, and `caseless`. In addition, `indeed` and `expect` have `andDoes`, `andShould`, `andHas`, `andHave`, `andIs`, `andTo`, and `andBe` which let you use multiple comparisons on the same object (chaining must be turned on). Most of these simply allow chaining with natural language. However, `deep` and `deeply` turn on deep object comparison when using `equal` (below), `not` and `Not` negate the comparison, and `caseless` and `noCase` turn on case insensitivity (for `equal`, `contains`, `key`, `keys`, `value`, and `values`).

#### Equals

Compares objects using `_.isEqual` when `deep` is applied and using `===` when it's not.

```javascript
if (indeed(1).equals(1))
if (indeed({foo: { bar: 'baz'}}).deeply.equals({foo: { bar: 'baz'}})
```

Aliases: `equal`, `eql`

#### Matches

Checks whether a string matches the given regular expression. If given a string, it will convert it to a RegExp object.

```javascript
if (indeed('foobar').matches(/oba/)) // or .matches('oba')
```

Aliases: `match`

#### A

For type comparisons. This is more strict that `typeof` however. It checks for constructor.name (allowing custom types) and, failing that, uses typeof. It is worth noting that both the type and comparison are lower cased, so 'string', 'String', 'strIng', etc. are all equivalent.

```javascript
if (indeed('hello').is.a('string'))
```

#### An

Just like isA but preferable (for me anyway) for types beginning with vowels.

```javascript
if (indeed([1, 2, 3]).is.an('array'))
```

#### Contains

Indicates if the string or array contains the given value.

```javascript
if (indeed('foo bar').contains('foo'))
if (indeed([1,2,3]).contains(1))
```

Aliases: `contain`, `indexOf`

#### Key

Indicates if the object (or array, though somewhat by accident) contains the given key.

```javascript
if (indeed({foo: 'bar'}).has.key('foo'))
```

Aliases: `containsKey`, `containKey`, `property`

#### Keys

Like `.key` but for multiple keys. Keys can be passed as an array or multiple strings.

```javascript
if (indeed({foo: 'bar', baz: 'quux'}).keys('foo', 'baz')
if (indeed({foo: 'bar', baz: 'quux'}).keys(['foo', 'baz']))
```

Aliases: `containKeys`, `keys`, `properties`

#### Value

Indicates if the object (or array) contains the given value.

```javascript
if (indeed({foo: 'bar'}).has.value('bar'))
```

Aliases: `containsValue`, `containValue`

#### Values

Like `.value` but for multiple values. Values can be passed as an array or multiple strings.

```javascript
if (indeed({foo: 'bar', baz: 'quux'}).has.values('bar', 'quux'))
if (indeed({foo: 'bar', baz: 'quux'}).has.values(['bar', 'quux']))
```

Aliases: `containsValues`, `containValues`

#### Defined

Returns true for everthing except undefined. A little cleaner looking than `if (typeof thing !== 'undefined')`, though that's exactly what it does under the hood.

```javascript
if (indeed('string').is.defined())
if (indeed(undefined).is.not.defined())
```

#### Null

Returns true for null and false for everything else.

```javascript
if (indeed(null).is.null())
if (indeed('string').is.not.null())
```

#### True

Not to be confused with truthiness, this checks for the literal value `true`.

```javascript
if (indeed(true).is.true())
```

#### False

Checks for the literal value `false`.

```javascript
if (indeed(false).is.false())
```

#### Truthy

Checks for truthiness.

```javascript
if (indeed(1).is.truthy())
```

#### Falsy

Checks for falsiness.

```javascript
if (indeed(0).is.falsy())
```

#### GreaterThan

Compares two numbers

```javascript
if (indeed(1).is.greaterThan(0))
```

Aliases: `gt`, `above`

#### LessThan
```javascript
if (indeed(1).is.lessThan(2))
```

Aliases: `lt`, `below`

#### GreaterThanOrEqualTo

```javascript
if (indeed(1).is.greaterThanOrEqualTo(1))
```

Aliases: `gte`

#### LessThanOrEqualTo

```javascript
if (indeed(1).is.lessThanOrEqualTo(1))
```

Aliases: `lte`

## Mixin

Additionally, `indeed` has a mixin method for extending these comparison methods. It takes an object of function names with corresponding functions.

```javascript
indeed.mixin({
  can: function(condition) {
    return function(val) {
      return typeof val[condition] === 'function';
    }
  },
  beginsWith: function(condition) {
    return function(val) {
      return val.charAt(0).toLowerCase() === condition.toLowerCase();
    }
  }
});
```

The custom functions should be in this form, where `condition` is the thing to match against and `val` is the original object (which seems a little backwards, since val is "inside"). These methods, for example, would be called like this:

```javascript
if (indeed({ foo: function() {} }).can('foo').test())
if (indeed('hello').beginsWith('h').test())
```

#### Tap

Executes a provided function, passing it `this`.

```javascript
if (indeed(a).and(b).tap(console.log).or(c))
```

## As an Assertion Library

I didn't write `indeed` to be an assertion library, but when I discovered that most assertion libraries don't return true/false values from their assertion methods, thereby making them unusable with mocha-given (which I use), I realized that `indeed` already had everything it needed (under the hood) to be that kind of assertion library. It just needed a few semantic changes to make it _sound_ like an assertion library.

#### Expect

`expect` is an alias to `indeed`. It does all the same stuff but sounds more test-ish.

```coffee
Given -> @thing = 'foo'
When -> @subject.doSomethingNeat(@thing)
Then -> expect(@thing).to.equal('foo bar')
```

#### Assert

`assert` is an alias to `eval`, `val`, and `test`. Once again, it's only purpose is to convey testing semantics. This only needs to be called when chaining multiple conditions.

```coffee
Then -> expect.chain('foo').to.be.a('string').and.to.match(/o$/).and(['bar']).to.contain('bar').assert()
```

#### Throw

Returns true if the passed function throws an error. An optional string, regex, error, or function can be passed for more refined assertions:

```javascript
expect(fn).to.throw();
expect(fn).to.throw('Inconceivable!');
expect(fn).to.throw(new Error('Mischief is afoot'));
expect(fn).to.throw(/timeout/);
expect(fn).to.throw(function(e) {
  return ~e.message.indexOf('!');
});
```

Aliases: `throws`

#### With

Assign parameters to pass to the invocation of a method to assert with throw:

```javascript
expect(fn).with('foo', 'bar').to.throw('FOO BAR'); // Passes 'foo' and 'bar' to fn when it's called
```


#### Spies

`expect` also checks it's parameter to see if it's a sinon spy or stub, and if it is, it extends itself with the spy, letting you call sinon methods (which are sometimes awkward) in more natural English. For example:

```javascript
var spy = sinon.spy()
// ... test things with the spy
expect(spy).to.have.been.called // Doesn't this feel more natural than 'spy.called'
```

#### When to use indeed for asserting

Indeed will work well with [mocha-given](https://github.com/rendro/mocha-given) or [jasmine-given](https://github.com/searls/jasmine-given), but it isn't a _full_ assertion library to be used in every project since it doesn't throw AssertionErrors or accept or generate messages (at least for now - perhaps in the next version I will get more abmitious). But because `Then -> true` is a passing test in Given style testing, it works well in that limited capacity.
